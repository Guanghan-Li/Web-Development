# Web Development Coursework

This repository gathers my CSEN161 Web Development coursework. Each folder here captures a different milestone in learning how to structure pages with HTML, style them with CSS, and progressively enhance them with JavaScript.

## Folder Overview
- `HTML_CSS`: Lab 2 deliverable that refines the Lab 1 blog layout with reusable CSS, semantic structure, and accessible navigation across the home, article, and articles listing pages.
- `Javascript`: Lab 3 deliverable that layers interactivity onto the article listing, including tag-based filtering and DOM manipulation patterns practiced with deferred scripts.
- `Personal_Resume`: Homework 1 multi-page personal site featuring education, experience, and contact sections, with shared styling assets under `css/` and supporting imagery in `Image/`.

## Archived Submissions
- `lab1.zip`: Original Lab 1 submission that establishes the base blog layout and content.
- `Lab2.zip`: Packaged Lab 2 submission, mirroring the `HTML_CSS` folder for grading.
- `Lab3.zip`: Packaged Lab 3 submission with JavaScript-powered article filtering.
- `HW1.zip`: Packaged Homework 1 submission containing the resume website.
